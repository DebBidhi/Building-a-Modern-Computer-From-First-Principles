# Project 4: Machine Language Programming


In this project, I developed two assembly programs for the Hack platform:

- **Mult.asm**: Multiplies the values in RAM[0] and RAM[1], storing the result in RAM[2].
- **Fill.asm**: Continuously monitors the keyboard input. When a key is pressed, it fills the screen with black; when no key is pressed, it clears the screen to white.

These programs were written using the Hack assembly language and tested using the Hack platform's CPU Emulator.

## Files

- `Mult.asm` – Assembly program to perform multiplication.
- `Fill.asm` – Assembly program to fill or clear the screen based on keyboard input.
