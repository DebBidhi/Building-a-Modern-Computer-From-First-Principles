# Building a Modern Computer From First Principles
This project provides a hands-on journey through the entire computing hierarchy, from basic logic gates all the way to high-level applications. This implementation includes all components developed throughout the course (Projects 1-11) plus an additional integration driver that completes the compilation pipeline. I completed this project in 2021-22 to gain a comprehensive understanding of computer systems, from low-level hardware to high-level software.
