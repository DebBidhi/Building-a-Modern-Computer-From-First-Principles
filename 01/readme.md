# Project 1: Boolean Logic


In this project, I built a set of basic logic gates that serve as the building blocks for computer hardware. Starting with the primitive NAND gate, I implemented the following gates:

- Not
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Mux
- DMux
- Not16
- And16
- Or16
- Mux16
- Or8Way
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way

Each gate was developed using the Hardware Description Language (HDL) provided by the course and tested with the supplied Hardware Simulator to ensure correct functionality.

## Files Included

- `.hdl` files: HDL implementations for each logic gate.
- `.tst` files: Test scripts to validate each gate's behavior.
- `.cmp` files: Expected output files for comparison during testing.îˆ†
