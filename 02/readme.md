# Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic

In this project, I built a series of combinational logic chips culminating in the ALU, which performs arithmetic and logical operations. The chips developed include:

- `HalfAdder.hdl`
- `FullAdder.hdl`
- `Add16.hdl`
- `Inc16.hdl`
- `ALU.hdl`

Each chip was implemented using the Hardware Description Language (HDL) and tested with the provided test scripts and comparison files to ensure correctness.
